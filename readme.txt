This script was made for mainly OBS, but usable with every screen recorder,
which support real-time file reading.

Before using for the first time, you need to install the "keyboard" module for python.
Copy the following command to your command prompt (without the quotation marks):
"pip install keyboard"
and hit return to install it.

The config file - cfg.csv - contains the keybinds and other customizable options, 
declared before the ";" separator.

The counter description supports UTF-8 encoding, feel free to use special characters, EXCEPT ";"
as I use it as a separator.
